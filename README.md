## Features in Detail

### Carbon Credit System

Our proprietary carbon credit system calculates and awards credits based on:
- Delivery distance
- Transport method (walking, cycling, electric vehicle)
- Packaging choices
- Vendor sustainability ratings

These credits can be redeemed for discounts, free deliveries, or donated to environmental projects.

### AI-Powered Route Optimization

Using advanced algorithms, we determine the most fuel-efficient routes while considering:
- Current traffic conditions
- Weather factors
- Delivery vehicle type
- Multi-delivery batching opportunities

This reduces unnecessary mileage and emissions while maintaining quick delivery times.

### Sustainable Packaging Solutions

We offer vendors:
- Biodegradable packaging options
- Reusable container programs
- Minimal packaging incentives
- Packaging carbon impact tracking
